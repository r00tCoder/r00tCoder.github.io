## HTB Sandworm (Medium) - Writeup

Difficulty: Medium  

This box revolves around a Flask web app with GPG-based functionality.  
By injecting SSTI payloads via GPG key names and signature verification, we achieve RCE.  
Enumeration reveals credentials and a Rust binary (tipnet) run via cron as root, which imports a custom logger crate we can write toâ€”allowing for privilege escalation.  
Finally, we exploit a known Firejail vulnerability (CVE-2022-31214) to escalate to root.
