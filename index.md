Welcome to my blog!

I'm an aspiring cybersecurity practitioner. I hold OSCP certification, as well as CCNA, CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701), and SBT Blue Team Level 1.

After graduating from a technical high school specializing in IT, Iâ€™ve been focused on developing both my networking and security skills through hands-on experience.

I enjoy building labs, testing real-world scenarios, and continuously challenging myself to grow.

My goal is to find a job in cybersecurity and become a well-rounded security professional by combining offensive and defensive knowledge in practical, impactful ways.

On this blog, Iâ€™ll be sharing detailed writeups of Hack The Box machines, CTF challenges, and practical notes from my learning journey â€” all aimed at helping others understand and apply cybersecurity concepts through real-world examples.

ðŸ‘‰ Currently open to cybersecurity roles â€” feel free to connect!.
